A few words about me

#intro
I'm from Brazil. I have a degree in civil engineering, but I have been a coder
since I was about seven years old. I seek to bring together concepts and ideas,
developing solutions, not just applications or buildings.

Knowledge and experience

#stack_description
On the one hand, within civil engineering, my notable projects were in the development of
structural designs for social enterprises, mainly churches. I also collaborated
in the construction of daycare centers, residential developments, among others.
On the other hand, as a web developer, my focus was on creating web applications
precisely because of their nature of working across multiple OSes. I have worked
in partnership with the City of Goi√¢nia on the Urban Drainage Master Plan (PDDU-GYN).
I have also developed tools for automating parts of the development of concrete
structural projects.
